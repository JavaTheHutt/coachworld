# TODO

1. add address model
   Think of line item address things but also how to handle current location - remote vs brick and mortar and geocaching

2. Need to create categories table

3. Discuss pricing models (coach rates) and how to handle that

4. image uploads - we should talk about this because it will incur storage costs. Might want to create `coach_images` table with urls to aws bucket
